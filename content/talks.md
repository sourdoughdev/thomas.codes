During the day I'm a Senior Developer on the [Shipping Services team at Shopify](https://shopify.com/shipping). We handle all things related to Shipping.

When I'm not shipping code related to *shipping*, I'm probably improving my sourdough technique or building apps to [help make me a better baker](https://bake.app).

### Get in touch

I'm always interested in talking code or sourdough, find me on [@tamcgoey](https://twitter.com/tamcgoey) or send an email to [hey@thomas.codes](mailto:hey@thomas.codes).
