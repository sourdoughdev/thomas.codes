This past week I've experimented a bit with getting up a new version of the site.

Last year my goal was simple - write _(well write a lot)._ Unfortunately things didn't work out as planned.

So... After spending quite a bit of time tinkering, I decided why not slap some new paint on and make it just a bit easier to write.

If anything, next year there will be a whole lot less of work to do.

## How do things work now?

I've switched over to [hugo](https://gohugo.io). I was hoping to try out [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) but the setup seemed a bit much for me.

Previously I was only using [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com), but with longer and longer build times - I thought it would be good to try something new.

Luckily there was a [great starter theme](https://github.com/siegerts/hugo-theme-basic), that was easy to build on.
