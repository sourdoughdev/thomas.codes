How do you launch both an Android and iOS app in a matter of weeks and still gain some of the benefits of going native?

I was tasked with building and launching two mobile versions for our iOS project - dash. Initially we started out building a native ios app, but when soon discovered most of our initial users were on android. Instead of rebuilding out a complete native version for android, we decided to adopt a hybrid approach and take advantage of Turbolinks 5 native wrappers.

### Some Takeaways

The benefits of going native, but why it might be best to reconsider a hybrid approach.

Learn how to integrate turbolinks native wrappers with Android and some pitfalls to avoid when building your native controls.

And finally, some things to watch out for when integrating turbolinks 5 into your rails app.

### Audience

If your rails developer thinking of dipping your toe into mobile development but aren't sure where to start, this talk will be geared to you.
