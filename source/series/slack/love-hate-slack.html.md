slack is supposedly where work happens - *and I mean sometimes that's the case*.

Like it or not, most of my teams communication centers around a handful of big slack channels.

Depending on the project you're working on or even the team, chances are you'll find yourself in quite a few channels.

One of the more interesting patterns I've seen emerge over the last year, is handling day to day team communication in large channels.

Take for example when you need to get a hold of your team.

Right now, there's about 3 different ways:

**1) @here + @channels.**

These notifications come in handy for things like the announcements channel, or in cases of a product launch.

But on the day to day - they tend to be noisy and distracting. *(heck, slack even has some basic tooling around cutting the noise).*

**2) Mentioning People Individually**

It works, but it just doesn't scale (at least when your team starts pushing three or four people).

Usually mentions are great for one-on-one communication, but fall short when it comes to tagging everyone you're needing to get a hold of.

**3) The slack Bot (the original bot)**

One thing I've seen emerge is using slack bot to trigger an auto-responder where a message usually follows that pings your team members individually.

It's a pain to setup and change on the fly, but it tends to be super effective when working in large public channels.

## So what's next

Getting a hold of your team should be painless. Falling back on using just @ mentions directly, is either too tedious or worse too noisy. 

There should be an easy way to ping the right people at the right time, without needing to tweak an auto responder each time.

Since I've been itching to start something on the side for some time, I thought it would be great to build out a tiny little app.

I'll be documenting things as I go - with the goal of practicing my own writing, and finally posting something up on this blog.

It's been almost two years - since I've actually paid attention to the craft of writing and teaching, and it would be great to start again.
