  In the past I've poured hundreds of hours over books, articles, videos,
  courses, and pretty much everything in between - and yet sometimes the best
  way to learn is to just ship something. Over the last two years at Shopify,
  I've seen and worked on some of the largest Rails apps in the world - I think
  it's time to branch out and learn how to build with a slightly different ruby
  framework: Hanami!
