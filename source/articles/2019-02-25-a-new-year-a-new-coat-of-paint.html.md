This past week I've experimented a bit with getting up a new version of the site.

Last year my goal was simple - write _(well write a lot)._ Unfortunately things didn't work out as planned.

So... After spending quite a bit of time tinkering, I decided why not slap some new paint on and make it just a bit easier to write.

If anything, next year there will be a whole lot less of work to do.

How do things work now?

I'm still using [trusty old middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/). For some reason my brain just thinks better in middleman, and I've been using it for the last few years.

Next, I've adopted something a little bit newer.

[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/), it's an amazing little CMS built right on top of GitHub + [Netlify](http://netlify.com).
